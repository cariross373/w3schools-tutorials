Work for Tutorials from W3Schools.com

Greetings Earthlings.

It has been a bit since I've worked my way through the W3Schools tutorials and felt the need for a refresher.

I have created this repo to house the work I'll be doing associated with this journey.

To render the index.html file, use https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/cariross373/w3schools-tutorials/blob/main/index.html

Thanks for the gander.
